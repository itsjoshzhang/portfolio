                        In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least GOAL total points, 
                        where GOAL defaults to 100. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. 
                        That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks consequences.

                        In this project, I have written a program that measures typing speed. Additionally, I have implemented typing autocorrect, 
                        which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project is inspired by
                        <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/"> Typeracer.</a>
